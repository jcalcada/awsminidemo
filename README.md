AWS Mini Demo:
The purpose of this kit is to allow you to generate CloudWatch and GuardDuty alerts.  It is based on script content created by Martin (thank you Martin) for the 2018 AWS conference.

If you copy this to your own repository the only thing you need to change is the services.js file and replace the keys with your own.
